# UAV Navigation: Hierarchical Path Optimization Using Neuro-Fuzzy Logic in QGIS  

This project focuses on **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) navigation** using a **hierarchical path optimization approach**. It leverages **Neuro-Fuzzy Logic** to improve decision-making, combining the adaptability of fuzzy logic with the learning capability of neural networks. The system is integrated with **QGIS** for geospatial analysis, allowing for precise route optimization in dynamic environments.  

### ðŸš€ Features  
- **QGIS Integration**: Uses QGIS for geospatial data visualization and processing.  
- **Hierarchical Decision-Making**: Divides path planning into structured layers for efficiency.  
- **Neuro-Fuzzy Optimization**: Combines neural networks and fuzzy logic for adaptive pathfinding.  
- **Dynamic Path Adjustment**: Considers terrain, obstacles, and environmental changes in real time.  
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balances speed, energy efficiency, and safety constraints.  

### ðŸ“Œ Applications  
âœ… UAV Path Planning  
âœ… Disaster Response & Emergency Navigation
