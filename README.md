# UAV Navigation: Hierarchical Path Optimization Using Neuro-Fuzzy Logic in QGIS
This project focuses on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) navigation using a hierarchical path optimization approach. It leverages Neuro-Fuzzy Logic to improve decision-making, combining the adaptability of fuzzy logic with the learning capability of neural networks. The system is integrated with QGIS for geospatial analysis, allowing for precise route optimization in dynamic environments.

ðŸš€ Features
QGIS Integration: Uses QGIS for geospatial data visualization and processing.
Hierarchical Decision-Making: Divides path planning into structured layers for efficiency.
Neuro-Fuzzy Optimization: Combines neural networks and fuzzy logic for adaptive pathfinding.
Dynamic Path Adjustment: Considers terrain, obstacles, and environmental changes in real time.
Multi-Objective Optimization: Balances speed, energy efficiency, and safety constraints.
